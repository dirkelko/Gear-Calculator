# Gear-Calculator (outdated! see [Gear-Calculator-UI5](https://github.com/dirkelko/Gear-Calculator-UI5/) instead!)
Online calculator for configuring and comparing bicycle gearing systems

The gear calculator (or in German Ritzelrechner) is an ongoing training project of mine to learn different programming languages and technologies like Java, Flex, Javascript, CSS ...and now Git.
It started 1995 with a Java based applet which displayed the gears of a bicycle graphically using awt. Around 2010 I rewrote it using Adobe Flex and included also hub gears. Now I am rewriting everything again with HTML5 and JavaScript.
Although the websites gear-calculator.com and ritzelrechner.de got quite popular among cyclists over the years and are heavily used now, the code is by no means an example for good programmimg style. To be homest I'm afraid it is pretty bad code. I just started fiddling around with HTML, Javascript and CSS without any proper education and most parts are the result of try and error. In fact the whole thing is my very first Javascript program.
So please restrain from copying anything from here. But I am thankful for comments and feedback which helps me to improve.
